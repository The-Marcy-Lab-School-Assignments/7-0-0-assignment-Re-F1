While you've identified some elements like buttons and headings, your component hierarchy isn't clear, and it doesn't fully represent the structure of the app. Try to focus on naming your components in a way that reflects their role in the app and clearly indicate parent-child relationships. This will help in better organizing and understanding the app's architecture.
