# Question

What is the return value of the `useState` hook in React? Be specific â€” just telling us the type is not enough.

# Answer

Anything that can be stored in JS can be stored in a state managed by `useState`.

Takes 2 diff parameters : State, and setState

#### This is what a useState hook looks like :

```js
const [state, setState] = useState({ name: "John", age: 30 });
```

A react hook for managing state within a React component. It returns an array with a state value and a setter function. It triggers the component to re-render when the state changes.

SetState will replace the set

You would never directly modify an object or array stored in useState. Instead, you should create a new updated version of the object or array and called `setState` so therefore you will modify

You can set null to an empty filter (for example)
