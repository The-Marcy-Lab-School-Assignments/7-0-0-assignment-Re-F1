# Question

In your own words, what is React and what are the benefits of using it?

# Answer

**React**Â is a JavaScript **library** for building reusable, composable, and scalable user-interfaces made up of components

We would want to use `react` as it combines html, dom, and javascript

`Component reusability` : streamline the application development process and create consistency across the applications developed by a group or organization


    Advantages of using JSX in React JS :
 - JSX helps us keep our code simpler and elegant when writing large pieces of code.
 - neater & easier
 - JSX also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.
 - Faster than normal JavaScript as it performs optimizations while translating to regular JavaScript.
